#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a) This has big o notation of O(n). The loop ends up with 3n which is negated by the implement 2n leaving as with the O(n) that scales well.


b)There is a nested loop that leaves us with O(nlogn)


c)the runtime is o(1) becyase the function is a constant.

## Exercise II

1. I would use a binary serach tree. This would in effect have me start at the middle floor of the building and the move to the corresponding quartile depending on whether the egg broke or not. Quickly and eventually we would be able to determine the first floor on which the egg wouldn't break. This search tree would have a big o notation of O(logn).
